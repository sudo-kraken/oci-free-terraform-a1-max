## Overview

This module provisions an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure environment tailored to the free-tier allowances. It creates compute, networking and storage to run useful workloads at zero cost where available.

The stack deploys:
- **1x VM.Standard.A1.Flex** instance with **4 OCPUs** and **24 GB RAM**
- **100 GB boot volume** plus an additional **100 GB block volume**
- A **Virtual Cloud Network** with subnets, security lists and an internet gateway

## Architecture at a glance

- Terraform defines:
  - VCN, public subnets, security lists and internet gateway
  - One A1 Flex compute instance
  - One attached block volume
- Opinionated security lists for typical access patterns
- Outputs expose public IP and key resource identifiers

## Features

- Free-tier friendly shapes and sizes
- Baseline networking with public access where required
- Automated plan and apply via GitHub Actions
- Automatic clean-up on failure to keep the tenancy tidy

## Prerequisites

- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account
- Terraform 1.6 or newer
- **OCI API credentials** stored as GitHub Secrets

### Secrets required

| Secret name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `PAT_TOKEN` | Personal access token used by the pipeline to check out the repository |
| `PKEY` | OCI SSH private key |
| `TENANCY_OCID` | OCID of your tenancy |
| `USER_OCID` | OCID of your user |
| `FP` | Fingerprint for the userâ€™s API key |
| `SSH_PUB_KEY` | SSH public key added to the instance for access |

## Automated deployment with GitHub Actions

The workflow **Execute OCI Pipeline** performs the following:

- Checks out the repository to the GitHub runner
- Sets up **Node.js** and the **Terraform CLI**
- Configures the SSH private key and Terraform variables from **GitHub Secrets**
- Initialises Terraform, creates a plan and applies it
- On failure, automatically destroys provisioned resources to return to a clean state

### GitHub Action execution

The root **`main.tf`** is the entry point used by the workflow. It wires the module, variables and any provisioners. As part of instance initialisation it **updates packages** and installs **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

### Accessing the instance

When the workflow completes successfully, the **public IP** is shown in the Terraform outputs. Connect using:

- Username: `opc`  
- Authentication: your SSH key corresponding to `SSH_PUB_KEY`

## Quick start

1. **Fork or clone** this repository into your GitHub account.
2. Add the **GitHub Secrets** listed above in your repository settings.
3. Review `main.tf` and variables for region, compartment and any tags.
4. Open the **Actions** tab, select **Execute OCI Pipeline**, provide inputs and **run** it.
5. Use the outputs to **SSH** to the instance as `opc`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Apply failed or timed out**  
  Check Actions logs for missing or incorrect secrets. Confirm tenancy, compartment and region values.
- **Cannot SSH**  
  Ensure `SSH_PUB_KEY` matches your private key and that security lists allow ingress from your IP.
- **Quota or capacity constraints**  
  Free-tier entitlements and regional capacity can vary. Try another region or adjust shapes.
